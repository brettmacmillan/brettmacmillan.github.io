	<p style="font-size:120%;""> I had a few normal highschool Jobs while I was in high school. The first of these jobs
	was working in the kitchen at Thornton Oaks. Thornton Oaks is a retirement community in Brunswick, Maine.
	While working here, my usual task were:</p>
	<li>Preparing foods (Easier foods such as salads, cookies, muffins, etc.)</li>
	<li>Cleaning (Moping floors, cleaning the kitchen appliances, etc.)</li>
	<li>Washing dishes (which is what I did for most of the shift)</li>
	<p style="font-size:120%;">Most of my shifts were 4-6hours long and I usually only worked about 20 hours
	a week. I started working at Thornton oaks in june 2015 and worked until about may 2017.
	
	<p style="font-size:120%;"> The second job I had during high school was a landscaping job also in Brunswick, Maine. 
	I worked for a small company called TightLines Landscaping. Our crew consisted of 5 and each day we would split into groups
	and go work on small landscaping jobs. Occasionally when we had a large job, the entire crew would go out and get it done together. 
	We did landscaping jobs in Brunswick, Harpswell, Topsham and Bath. These jobs usually consisted of tasks such as, mowing lawns, spring clean ups,
	mulching gardens, and basically any other landscaping job you could think of. I usually worked 6-8 hour days 5 days a week. I worked for TightLines from June 2017-August 2017.
	 I only worked here during this past summer and unfortunately had to stop working pretty early because of school.
