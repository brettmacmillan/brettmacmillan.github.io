	<p style="font-size:110%;">Throughout highschool I participated in a few schools sports. I played
	football for a few of my highschool years but unfortunately couldn't play all
	four years. When I played I played as an offensive guard although many of the 
	other kids who played that position were much bigger than I was. I unfortunately
	had to quit after my sophomore year because I needed to work so I could have money to ski in the winter</p>

	<p style="font-size:20;"> 	The other sport that I played all throughout highschool was baseball.
	Baseball has always been one of my favorite sports and I have played for as long as I can remember.
	In highschool I only played varsity my junior and senior year. I quickly earned a staring spot my junior year 
	and continued to start for the rest of my highschool career. At the beginning of my senior year I was voted captain
	and was given the coaches award which doesn't sound like a great accomplishment but it was the only award the baseball 
	program gives out at my highschool</p>
	
	<p style="font-size:110%;"> My favorite sport is easily skiing. Although I've only been skiing for a few years, I've developed a passion for the sport.
	My friends and I have been driving to sugarloaf every weekend for a few years. We mostly ski park and work on doing tricks such as spins and flips off the jumps.
